      <p>I am a proud graduate of Pomona College and I recently received my PhD from the <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/">Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Department of Biostatistics</a>. My main PhD work involved developing a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.05360">robust Bayesian framework for quantification</a> with applications to mortality surveillance, under the guidance of my advisor <a href="http://abhidatta.com/">Dr. Abhirup Datta</a>, and in collaboration with <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/784/scott-l-zeger">Dr. Scott Zeger</a> and the <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/institute-for-international-programs/current-projects/countrywide-mortality-surveillance-for-action-comsa-in-mozambique/">COMSA</a> team. I also have developed an approach for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301620311470">improving survival evaluation to guide bone metastases management using random survival forests</a>, and have worked on studies for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6774252/">early cancer detection using cell-free DNA</a>.</p>
