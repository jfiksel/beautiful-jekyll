I am a proud graduate of Pomona College and current fifth year PhD student in the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/). My current advisor is [Dr. Abhirup Datta](http://abhidatta.com/), with whom I collaborate with [Dr. Scott Zeger](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/784/scott-l-zeger) and the [COMSA](https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/institute-for-international-programs/current-projects/countrywide-mortality-surveillance-for-action-comsa-in-mozambique/) team on developing a robust Bayesian framework for quantification with applications to mortality surveillance.
