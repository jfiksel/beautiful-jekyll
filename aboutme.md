title: About me
---

I am a proud graduate of Pomona College and I recently received my PhD from the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/). My main PhD work involved developing a robust Bayesian framework for quantification with applications to mortality surveillance, under the guidance of my advisor [Dr. Abhirup Datta](http://abhidatta.com/), and in collaboration with [Dr. Scott Zeger](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/784/scott-l-zeger) and the [COMSA](https://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/institute-for-international-programs/current-projects/countrywide-mortality-surveillance-for-action-comsa-in-mozambique/) team. I also have developed an approach for improving survival evaluation to guide bone metastases management using random survival forests, and have worked on studies for [early cancer detection using cell-free DNA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6774252/)
