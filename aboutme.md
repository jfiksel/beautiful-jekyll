title: About me
---

I am a proud graduate of Pomona College and current second year PhD student in the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Department of Biostatistics](http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/). My current advisor is [Dr. Rob Scharpf](http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2562/robert-scharpf), with whom I collaborate with [Dr. Victor Velculescu's](https://igm.jhmi.edu/faculty/Victor-Velculescu) lab on problems related to cancer genomics. I am also a co-leader, along with Lamar Hunt III, of the department's [computing club](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~ydu/comp_club.html).
